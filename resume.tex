\section{\faLeaf\ Objective}  I am an experienced professional currently re-training for a career in the computing industry. After starting my career as a US Merchant Marine Officer, I have subsequently worked in the maritime shipping and logistics industry and the New York City industrial warehouseing market. In many of my roles I took on additional work focused on the computer systems which were being used. I believe that my experience in the traditional shipping and industrial logistics fields gives me unique insight into building and maintaining software platforms. I am seeking a position in the field of computing, with special interest in systems programming, computer perception, embedded interfaces and distributed computing platforms.
